They say it's about the journey. And what a journey that was. With this post, I just keep the rhythm of this blog by reflecting on my London trip. Not much happened with the app except communication, some fixes and refactorings.
</p>
<p>
    Last week's 3 main achievements:
</p>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Going to London, attending the LRA Focus Group, meeting Gabriele my accountability buddy in person.</li>
        <li>Talking to Brian about the App and brainstorming with Dre and Gabriele.</li>
        <li>Checking into a spook house, organizing a new flight back to Zurich after missing the original one and then surviving a devestating migraine/nervous breakdown which culminated in sync with the boarding process.</li>

<h2>2 Shades of London</h2>
<p>
    The check in was even spookier:
</p>
<p>
    <img width="100%" src="/blog-images/londonrealapp/4/IMG_0142.JPG" class="ft-shadow">
</p>
<p>
    Then, working in a Coffice, I remembered why I once fell in love with London. Frequently, I found myself in the middle of a startup meeting:
</p>
<p>
    <img width="100%" src="/blog-images/londonrealapp/4/IMG_0144.JPG" class="ft-shadow">
</p>
<p>
    Android is that underground thing...
</p>
<p>
    <img width="100%" src="/blog-images/londonrealapp/4/IMG_0140.JPG" class="ft-shadow">
</p>
<p>
    ... while the Apple Store is the only London sight I had to visit:
</p>
<p>
    <img width="100%" src="/blog-images/londonrealapp/4/IMG_0153.JPG" class="ft-shadow">
</p>
<p>
    However, this gentleman argued you should destroy <i>something</i> in order to retain focus and inspiration. He made a good point:
</p>
<p>
    <img width="100%" src="/blog-images/londonrealapp/4/IMG_0167.JPG" class="ft-shadow">
</p>
<h2>Now what about the App?</h2>
<p>
Emails and live brain storming revolved around meta data for episodes, in particular around transcripts, chapters and tags.
</p>
<p>One important take away: We'll create full transcripts through a hybrid approach of combining manual work and algorithms. We'll start with the latest episodes and go back from there.
</p>
<p>What we need are actually subtitles: transcripts with precise timing information. Not an easy task. But when it's done, we can deliver crazy powerful searching and browsing features to the user.
</p>
<p>
Other than that, there was a lot of dreaming going on ;) Big ideas in spite of a small budget. Ambitious and creative. Love it.
</p>
<p>
    The trip got me thinking. I wanna invest more time in this app and the things I love. I need to quit my job and do what I wanted to do since forever. What I'm <i>meant</i> to do. I need a way out. So I'll find one.
