<p>
  Hey, I'm Sebastian. I'm founder and chief software artist of Flowtoolz. I started coding in 1994, studied fine arts, computer and media science and got my master's degree in information engineering from Konstanz University.
</p>
<p>
  I've worked as a research assistant, web developer, editor and as software engineer for iOS, tvOS and macOS. My focus always goes to the big picture. In Software Engineering this translates to the question: <i>What is a natural clean design and clean architecture of software?</i>
</p>
<p>
  I also love reading and writing non-fiction, functional fitness, the game of Go, learning new stuff, positive psychology, producing pop songs, the paleo lifestyle, barefoot running, zen meditation and discussions with interesting positive people.
