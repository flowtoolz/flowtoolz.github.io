    The 3 main achievements of last week:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>The prototype provides infos and description for each episode and allows to enter and leave full screen mode even while playing.</li>
    <li>The prototype now loads all its content from Vimeo and complements the video infos with statistics from Youtube.</li>
    <li>The prototype has a fully customized design, including custom focus animations for views and table view cells.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>
    Topshelf
</h2>
<p>
The topshelf with high resolution images from Vimeo:

<h2>
    Episode List
</h2>
<p>
We load HD videos from Vimeo and present them in London Real style. The view counts are accumulated from Vimeo and Youtube:

<h2>
    Episode Infos
</h2>
<p>
Selecting an episode opens the info page with the video in focus. Likes and dislikes are from Youtube.

<p>
Selecting the video brings it to the full screen:

</p>
<p>
Here's the episode info page with the description in focus. All focus changes are animated:

</p>
<p>
We can also bring the description to full screen. Just ignore the layout for now:

</p>
<p>
Here on the right, we might show the table of contents to let the user jump to specific topics within the episode:

<h2>
    Process
</h2>
<p>
A lot has happened since I introduced the prototype. Here is another snaphot of the project's Trello board:

Btw: <i>Backlog</i> is a brain dump of potential future tasks. <i>Workbench</i> contains tasks I'm currently working on. Both these lists are roughly prioritised. I add completed tasks to the top of the <i>Review</i> list.
