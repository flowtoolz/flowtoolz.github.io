title:  "Closing In On The Appstore"
---

<p>
    Last week's 3 main achievements:
</p>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>I added buttons for an <i>About</i> page and for gathering user feedback. Also, we improved many aspects of the chapter list.</li>
        <li>The release draws nearer, so we took account of what's left to do and I already jumped through a few hoops of Apple's release process.</li>
        <li>I quit my job to have more time for projects like this, registered a business and started building a website for it.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<h2>Feedback Loop</h2>
<p>
    On the episode list screen, we now display an email for user feedback as well as a button that opens an About page. The call to action for the academy had to be simplified:

</p>
<p>
     Closing the feedback loop beyond just App Store ratings is extremely important. That's why the call to give feedback is so prominent in the app.
</p>
<h2>Chapters</h2>
<p>
The app now loads chapter information from a server, so we can extend that data without requiring users to update the app.
</p>
<p>
We also added chapters to more episodes, streamlined the process of adding chapters and upgraded their quality. Big thanks to <a href="https://londonrealacademy.com/members/woon-tan/" target="blank">Woon</a> who creates high quality data for this feature!
</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
    As (almost) always, here's a current snaphot of the project's Trello board:

<h2>Flowtoolz</h2>
<p>
    So I just fucking jumped out of the plane :) And I've never been so motivated, confident and excited about a decision.
</p>
<p>
    I quit my job, registered Flowtoolz as a company and started building a responsive umbrella website around this blog.
</p>
<p>
    Over the next months, Flowtoolz will grow into a business. And with that, this blog will broaden its scope and include topics beyond the London Real App. Watch the space.
