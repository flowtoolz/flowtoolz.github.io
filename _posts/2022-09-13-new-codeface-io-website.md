I'm sunsetting flowtoolz.com in favour of <a href="https://www.codeface.io">Codeface.io</a>. The new site focuses  on software architecture and the Codeface app, which visualizes the architecture and quality of codebases â€“ supporting virtually all programming languages.

There will be no new articles here. The existing software-related articles will re-appear over at <a href="https://www.codeface.io">Codeface.io</a>. New articles willl also appear there and embrace the new focus.

The new site will repurpose some of the contents that you still find here. At some point, though, flowtoolz.com will vanish into the digital beyond.
