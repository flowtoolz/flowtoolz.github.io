## [Flowtoolz Github](https://github.com/flowtoolz/Flowtoolz)

I just started to put some re-usable code on Github. [Check it out here.](https://github.com/flowtoolz/Flowtoolz) This will become a cocoapod and a carthage framework. Of course I still need to refactor, curate, document and expand it.

## Flowtoolz Studio

Since around 1996, I've been growing (gardening?) a music home studio, and I'm pretty happy with the minimal but very effective and high quality result. Since I'm drifting more and more to the production side, I collaborate with musicians and produce their demos.

## [Flowlist](http://flowlistapp.com)

A real minimal but viable and fun macOS app for taking notes and managing tasks. Check out <http://flowlistapp.com>. I created it for myself out of frustration with all the task management apps I intensely used before. Now I'm happy using flowlist daily since summer 2017. There's much more to come for this project..

## 33 Day Diary

A structured journal that leads through a sort of meditation routine for 33 days. I wanted something like the [five minute journal](http://fiveminutejournal.com) but I also was inspired to integrate some extensions into that idea and I wanted it to be a beautiful handcrafted book...

## [Sanitas Active](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/sanitas-active/id1140475651)

A fitness tracking app I wrote for Sanitas Grundversicherungen AG as freelancer at JLS DIGITAL AG. [Check it out in the AppStore]().

## Cocoalytics

A concept for a code visualization and quality analytics tool around iOS, macOS and tvOS. Although there's not even a prototype done, I've done a lot of conceptual work, copywriting, market analysis and so forth... And I explored the idea through the London Real Business Accelerator. I will pick this up at some point.

## [Londonreal TV](http://londonrealapp.com)

I created the Londonreal TV app for Apple's tvOS, from concept to release. Check out a little teaser here: <http://londonrealapp.com> or download it from the tvOS AppStore.

## Pareto Speak

A simple but highly effective app for expanding your vocabulary in your own or in a foreign language. It trains your recall of the most used terms that you recently didn't know. The prototype worked well, I hope I can pick this up at some point.

## Human-Audio Interaction Lab

During my master studies in Information Engineering, I became obsessed with a vision of a novel interface for composing music. So I made it the subject of my thesis. While I still stand behind the 30+ requirements I established, my solution suffered from overthinking, and the academic prototype is not a minimal viable product. I don't know that I will ever come back to this, since other passion projects have more commercial potential.

## [Vooxly](https://www.instagram.com/vooxly/)

A video voiceover app that I wrote for Socialbit GmbH. It was the first major app that I coded.

## [Mellowtree](https://www.facebook.com/mellowtreemusic/)

[Mellowtree](https://www.facebook.com/mellowtreemusic/) is my indie pop project. I follow this vision since around 1996 and created hundreds of ideas. Currently I'm focusing on generating more valid output and work on 10 tracks for an album.
