# More Is More

## [Flowtoolz Github](https://github.com/flowtoolz/Flowtoolz)

I just started to put some re-usable code on Github. [Check it out here.](https://github.com/flowtoolz/Flowtoolz) This will become a cocoapod and a carthage framework. Of course I still need to refactor, curate, document and expand it.

## StockToolz

In 2017, I got into trading stocks, in particular swing trading via chart technique. I built an app that visualizes historic stock data from an unofficial yahoo finance API. The app also allowed me to test simple strategies and see how they compete. I made money with every single trade, but I wasn't too systematic about it. I'll certainly come back to this project in the future.

## Flowtoolz Studio

Since around 1996, I've been growing (gardening?) a music home studio, and I'm pretty happy with the minimal but very effective and high quality result. Since I'm drifting more and more to the production side, I collaborate with musicians and produce their demos.

## [Flowlist](http://flowlistapp.com)

A real minimal but viable and fun macOS app for taking notes and managing tasks. Check out <http://flowlistapp.com>. I created it for myself out of frustration with all the task management apps I intensely used before. Now I'm happy using flowlist daily since summer 2017. There's much more to come for this project..

## 33 Day Diary

A structured journal that leads through a sort of meditation routine for 33 days. I wanted something like the [five minute journal](http://fiveminutejournal.com) but I also was inspired to integrate some extensions into that idea and I wanted it to be a beautiful handcrafted book...

## Cocoalytics

A concept for a code visualization and quality analytics tool around iOS, macOS and tvOS. Although there's not even a prototype done, I've done a lot of conceptual work, copywriting, market analysis and so forth... And I explored the idea through the London Real Business Accelerator. I will pick this up at some point.

## Zen in the Art of Software Architecture

... is the tongue-in-cheek working title of a book I'm writing. It will be a casual and entertaining but also consistent and systematic dive into the fundamental principles that make software hold together or fall apart.

I've been obsessing about the nature of software structure since I started coding in 1994 at age 12. Now I'm gathering and integrating all my notes and writings around the subject. The draft is currently around 80 pages.

The book is not exclusively directed at coders, but at everyone in the periphery of software development. It will have no code in it, not even pseudo code! It offers a fundamental and new perspective on the structural and qualitative aspects of software, and it will have lots of hand-drawn diagrams.

## ParetoSpeak

A simple but highly effective app for expanding your vocabulary in your own or in a foreign language. It trains your recall of the most used terms that you recently didn't know. The prototype worked well, I hope I can pick this up at some point.

## Human-Audio Interaction Lab

During my master studies in Information Engineering, I became obsessed with a vision of a novel interface for composing music. So I made it the subject of my thesis.

While I still stand behind the 30+ requirements I established, my solution suffered from overthinking, and the academic prototype is not a minimal viable product. I don't know that I will ever come back to this, since other passion projects have more commercial potential.

## [Mellowtree](https://www.facebook.com/mellowtreemusic/)

[Mellowtree](https://www.facebook.com/mellowtreemusic/) is my indie pop project. I follow this vision since around 1996 and created hundreds of ideas. Currently I'm focusing on generating more valid output and work on 10 tracks for an album.

## Academic Writings

* [Idea for a metric distance function ("semantic diameter") on n feature vectors, rooted in information theory](writings/metric_distance_function_idea.pdf)
   - ... While I developed and formulated the above idea, I sifted through the scientific literature for weeks. However, I couldn't find this articulated anywhere. This may have changed. If anyone has seen a description, term or formula for this, please let me know!

      This distance function seems very appropriate and natural for clustering, information retrieval and data mining applications where objects (like documents) can be expressed as probability vectors (like term frequencies). It's a metric, applicable to sets of n vectors (documents), and it's actually based on measuring information (entropy). Having considered many practical criteria, I'm convinced this function expresses semantic distance better than any other distance function I came across.
