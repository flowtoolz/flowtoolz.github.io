## Manifesto

#### Our Conviction
We are experienced, principled and oppinionated software craftsmen who believe there often <i>is</i> a right and a wrong way to do things.

<i>Agile</i> is not a marketing buzzword to us. We carry the ideas of the agile manifesto in our hearts. All our work rests on the following three principles.

#### Domain-Driven Design
We immerse ourselves into your application domain and model its mechanics together with you. We are convinced that a deep understanding of the domain makes for excellent software and excellent partnerships.

Our domain-driven approach entails that we are not attached to any technology. Instead we apply the technologies that best serve your goal.

#### Craftsmanship
We sustain development speed even in late stages of complex projects because we apply test-driven development and produce clean code and architecture.

Since clean architecture yields highly reusable code, we're constantly growing a code library that powers development accross different projects.

#### Rapid Iteration
Delivering in rapid iterations allows us to scale the product with the invested resources and to react quickly to new information.

With each iteration, we deliver a viable product by implementing the feature that offers the greatest return of investment.

### Professional Network
We collaborate with selected experts from all kinds of professional backgrounds like computer science, fine arts, business administration and marketing.

Rather than being detached employees, we are invested partners, proactive, self-reliant, independent and creative.
