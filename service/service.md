## Manifesto

#### Our Conviction
We are experienced, principled and oppinionated software craftsmen who believe there often <i>is</i> a right and a wrong way to do things.

<i>Agile</i> is not a marketing buzzword to us. We carry the ideas of the agile manifesto in our hearts. All our work rests on the following three principles.

#### Domain-Driven Design
We immerse ourselves into your application domain and model its mechanics together with you. We are convinced that a deep understanding of the domain makes for excellent software and excellent partnerships.

Our domain-driven approach entails that we are not attached to any technology. Instead we apply the technologies that best serve your goal.

#### Craftsmanship
We sustain development speed even in late stages of complex projects because we apply test-driven development and produce clean code and architecture.

Since clean architecture yields highly reusable code, we're constantly growing a code library that powers development accross different projects.

#### Rapid Iteration
Delivering in rapid iterations allows us to scale the product with the invested resources and to react quickly to new information.

With each iteration, we deliver a viable product by implementing the feature that offers the greatest return of investment.
