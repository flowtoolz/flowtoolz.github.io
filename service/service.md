# Got a Great Business Or Idea?

## We don't just build the app

* We also understand your goal, help you work out a strategy and then build exactly the app that lets you implement your vision.

* You already have a code base but the project is in a rut? Let's analyze it, improve the architecture and get up to speed again!

* Let's bring you and your app to the right platforms and people. We customize your app and market it tailored to your budget.

## Selected Projects

### MyAIDA

I'm helping the team at the [Costa Digital Unit](http://costadigital.io) rebuild the MyAIDA app for iOS. The app lets guests of [AIDA Cruises](https://www.aida.de) see what's going on on their cruise ship, book events, chat with each other and more.

A [fitness tracking iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/sanitas-active/id1140475651) that I wrote for [Sanitas Grundversicherungen AG](https://www.sanitas.com) as a freelancer at [JLS Digital AG](http://www.jls.ch). It rewards running, swimming and cycling and supports AppleHealth, Garmin and Fitbit.

### [Allianz oneMobile](https://www.allianz.com/de/produkte_loesungen/globale_geschaeftseinheiten/amos/)

I helped the team at [Allianz Managed Operations & Services SE](https://www.allianz.com/de/produkte_loesungen/globale_geschaeftseinheiten/amos/) create a platform with which worldwide organizational units of [Allianz SE](https://www.allianz.com) build, test and deliver native and cross-platform apps.

### [London Real TV](http://www.flowtoolz.com/londonrealapp)

I created the [Londonreal TV app](http://www.flowtoolz.com/londonrealapp) for Apple's tvOS, from concept to release. You can watch the latest full London Real episodes for free and explore episodes through a table of contents.

### [HolidayCheck](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/holidaycheck/id431838682?mt=8)

### [Vooxly](https://www.instagram.com/vooxly/)

A [social video app](https://www.instagram.com/vooxly/) that I developed for Socialbit GmbH. It lets you send video messages, record voiceovers and do basic editing like selecting background music from your iTunes library.

## Manifesto

#### Our Conviction
We are experienced, principled and opinionated software craftsmen who believe there often <i>is</i> a right and a wrong way to do things.

<i>Agile</i> is not a marketing buzzword to us. We carry the ideas of the [agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) in our hearts. All our work rests on the following four principles.

#### Domain-Driven Design
We immerse ourselves into your application domain and model its mechanics together with you. We are convinced that a deep understanding of the domain makes for excellent software and excellent partnerships.

Our [domain-driven](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179133.Domain_Driven_Design) approach entails that we are not attached to any technology. Instead we apply the technologies that best serve your goal.

#### Craftsmanship
We sustain development speed even in late stages of complex projects because we apply [test-driven development](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13705089-test-driven-ios-development) and produce [clean code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code) and [architecture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18043011-clean-architecture).

Since clean architecture yields highly reusable code, we're constantly growing a code library that powers development across different projects.

#### Rapid Iteration
Delivering in rapid iterations allows us to scale the product with the invested resources and to react quickly to new information.

With each iteration, we deliver a viable product by implementing the feature that offers the greatest return of investment.

### Professional Network
Rather than being detached employees, we are invested partners, proactive, self-reliant, independent and creative.

We don't know everything. But we know people for everything, from various networks and professional backgrounds. We collaborate with selected experts, but won't hesitate to forward your project to a partner, if they are a better fit. The point is: you'll be happy.
