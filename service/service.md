<h1 style="text-align:center">Manifesto</h1>

<div class="grid-x small-up-1 medium-up-2 grid-margin-y grid-margin-x">

   <div class="cell">
      <h3>Our Conviction</h3>
      <p>
      We are experienced, principled and opinionated software craftsmen who believe there often <i>is</i> a right and a wrong way to do things.
      </p>
      <p>
      <i>Agile</i> is not a marketing buzzword to us. We carry the ideas of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">agile manifesto</a> in our hearts. All our work rests on the following four principles.
      </p>
   </div>

   <div class="cell">
      <h3>Domain-Driven Design</h3>
      <p>
      We immerse ourselves into your application domain and model its mechanics together with you. We are convinced that a deep understanding of the domain makes for excellent software and excellent partnerships.
      </p>
      <p>
      Our <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179133.Domain_Driven_Design">domain-driven</a> approach entails that we are not attached to any technology. Instead we apply the technologies that best serve your goal.
      </p>
   </div>

   <div class="cell">
      <h3>Craftsmanship</h3>
      <p>
      We sustain development speed even in late stages of complex projects because we apply <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13705089-test-driven-ios-development">test-driven development</a> and produce <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code">clean code</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18043011-clean-architecture">architecture</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Since clean architecture yields highly reusable code, we're constantly growing a code library that powers development across different projects.
      </p>
   </div>

   <div class="cell">
      <h3>Rapid Iteration</h3>
      <p>
      Delivering in rapid iterations allows us to scale the product with the invested resources and to react quickly to new information.
      </p>
      <p>
      With each iteration, we deliver a viable product by implementing the feature that offers the greatest return of investment.
      </p>
   </div>

   <div class="cell">
      <h3>Professional Network</h3>
      <p>
      Rather than being detached employees, we are invested partners, proactive, self-reliant, independent and creative.
      </p>
      <p>
      We don't know everything but we know people for everything, from various networks and professional backgrounds. We collaborate with selected experts but won't hesitate to forward your project to a partner, if they are a better fit.
      </p>
   </div>
