# Codeface Privacy Policy

## What information do we collect?

We do not collect any information at all. Nor do we have access to the codebases that Codeface analyzes. All analysis results remain on your local computer.

## Do we use cookies?

Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computerâ€™s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the Website to recognize your browser and, if you have a registered account, associate it with your registered account.

We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We use Google Analytics to better understanding our Website visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.

You may refuse these cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser or by downloading and installing a [browser plug-in](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB).

## Do we disclose any information to outside parties?

Since we do not collect it, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.
