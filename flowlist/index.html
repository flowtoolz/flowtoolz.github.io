                    <h3>The Familiar</h3>
                    Like other task managers, Flowlist shows 3 main views: A task list in the middle, an overview on the left for context, and a detail view on the right showing details like subtasks of the selected task.
                </div>
                <div class="column column-block">
                    <h3>More Flexible</h3>
                    Unlike other task managers, Flowlist does not force your stuff into fixed categories like <i>Project</i> or <i>Subtask</i>. In Flowlist, tasks may contain tasks, and that's it. You can create any hierarchy of tasks.
                </div>
                <div class="column column-block">
                    <h3>Yet More Elegant</h3>
                    In Flowlist, the 3 main views are all task lists. Each shows the details of what is selected in the list to its left. Just hit the left or right Arrow Key to slide the context or the detail view into focus.

                <div class="column column-block">
                    <h3>Navigate</h3>Use <span class="fl-command-span">↑</span> or <span class="fl-command-span">↓</span> to select a different task. You can go up and down within a list. You can also move the focus left to the overview list or right to the subtasks of the currently selected task.
                </div>
                <div class="column column-block">
                    <h3>Add and Delete</h3>Hit <span class="fl-command-span">Space</span> to add a task to the top of the list. Or use <span class="fl-command-span">↵</span> and <span class="fl-command-span">⌫</span> to write and delete tasks just like lines or words in a text.

                <div class="column column-block">
                    <h3>Prioritize</h3>Use <span class="fl-command-span">⌘↑</span> or <span class="fl-command-span">⌘↓</span>, to move a single selected task up or down in the list. Thereby you can visually prioritize tasks. You can also move completed tasks that were put to the end of the list.

                <div class="column column-block">
                    <h3>Do Batch Processing</h3>Some actions can be applied to multiple tasks at once. To select multiple tasks, use <span class="fl-command-span">⇧↑</span> and <span class="fl-command-span">⇧↓</span>. Or hold <span class="fl-command-span">⌘</span> while clicking a task to add or remove it from the selection.

                <div class="column column-block">
                    <h3>Start and Pause</h3>Hit <span class="fl-command-span">⌘→</span> to set tasks in progress or to pause them. Tasks in progress slide to the top. Paused tasks slide back down.

                <div class="column column-block">
                    <h3>Check Off</h3>Click its check box to complete a task. Or hit <span class="fl-command-span">⌘←</span> to complete the first active selected task. When completing tasks they move below the last active task, so you'll see them sorted by order of completion.
                </div>
                <div class="column column-block">
                    <h3>Rename</h3>Hit <span class="fl-command-span">⌘↵</span> to rename the first selected task. If multiple tasks are selected, entering the name for one task immediately unselects that task and begins editing the name of the next selected task.
                </div>
                <div class="column column-block">
                    <h3>Group</h3>Select multiple tasks and hit <span class="fl-command-span">↵</span> to group the selection and name the group. Tasks that contain others as subtasks have an arrow indicator. If you select such a task, the detail list on the right shows the subtasks.
                </div>
                <div class="column column-block">
                    <h3>Add Subtasks</h3>If a task has no subtasks, you can still focus its subtask list and start adding tasks there. The group indicator in the overview list on the left appears/disappears when the focused list becomes non-empty/empty.
