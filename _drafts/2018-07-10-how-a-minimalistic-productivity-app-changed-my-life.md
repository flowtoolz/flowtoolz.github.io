## 1. Why I Built Flowlist

Sometimes, I feel overwhelmed by all the stuff I have to do, and even more by all the stuff I'm passionate about. So, most of my life, I've been on a quest to sort myself out, get more shit done and turn more ideas into real things.

The task managers I used to organize my TODOs and **thoughts** played a central role in that quest. And I've used them all, some for a long time: Todoist, Wunderlist, Agenda, Omnifocus, Flow, Anydo, Things, Trello and Apple's Reminders app.

You guessed it - I found all those task managers frustrating. They just felt rigid, cumbersome and distracting. One particular aspect they all share doesn't jive at all with the way I think: They force your notes into fixed categories like *Project*, *Task*, *Subtask* and *Description*.

However reality isn't fragmented by such arbitrary categories, much less can you know the category or abstraction level of a thought the moment it pops into your head. The structure of ideas, tasks or "projects" rather emerges from the process of thinking about- or working on them.

Because they are so rigid, conventional task managers are really bad at capturing thoughts, brainstorming, developing ideas through "live thinking" or iterating over tasks and projects over time.

I need to evolve my captured items to keep them in line with reality. I need a tool that supports an agile (i.e. realistic) way of thinking, working and living. That means, it must allow to freely mould the item hierarchy: Group items together, add sub items "into" an item, move items to a whole different level, and so forth.

So in June 2017, I prototyped a novel kind of task manager and named it **Flowlist**. And I've been happily using it every day since. This year, I decided to turn Flowlist into much more and make it available to you. Now, after 564 Git commits, Flowlist is finally [available on the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/flowlist/id1396163478?ls=1).

## 2. How Flowlist Works

Flowlist is radically simple but subtle and powerful. This 30 second clip shows some work flows in action:

</video>

Flowlist is designed to support deep focus and working in a flow state. It does that through a couple of seemingly radical design choices. Let's look at the 3 most important ones ...

### 2.1. A Simple But Universal Data Model

Flowlist does not force your stuff into categories like project, task, subtask or description. Instead, there are just titled items. But those items may contain other items, just like folders on your computer.

So you evolve your own item hierarchy:

* Group items together
* Add subitems into any item
* Move items to a whole different level in the hierarchy, i.e. into any other item including the root or "home" item.

There's no limit to how deeply nested your items can be, and you can edit this hierarchy in every way to keep it true to your life

### 2.2. Total Control Via Few Keys

A core characteristic of Flowlist is that its simplicity allows the user to control it without mouse or trackpad. With just a few intelligently laid out key commands, the user has all the power at his fingertips. And that's only suitable for a productivity app that takes a lot of text input anyway.

This keyboard-centric input has some nice implications:

* It is fast.
* Input is uninterrupted. Your hands never have to leave the keyboard for anything. That also means your attention can stay zoned in on the content on the screen.
* It allows the interface to be super clean, without any distracting clutter.

### 2.3. An Immersive UI: Clean, Focused and Animated

* You chose the scope of your focus by navigating your item hierarchy. No matter on what level you are, there's always an overview to the left and possibly details of a selected item to the right. You always focus and edit the list in the middle.
* There's nothing else that could distract you. The interface is super clean. No buttons, knobs, alerts, popups and such clutter.
* All navigation and editing is animated. So it's easy for the eyes to keep track of where you are and how the items and the overall item structure changes.
* The UI is best used in fullscreen mode. However, Flowlist also provides a "Monotasking" mode in which all other apps, the dock and the menu bar are hidden. Those modes support deep focus.
* All window management can be done via key commands as well, and those commands go both ways: they activate and deactivate the respective mode:
    - Enter/leave fullscreen: ⌘F
    - Monotasking/multitasking: ⌘M
    - Close/show window: ⌘W

## 3. How I Use Flowlist

I use Flowlist to:

* Capture whatever pops into my head
* Support my thought processes
* Evolve notes into ideas
* Manage tasks and projects
* Plan my day and my future

Now, Flowlist can do all these things, not because it's packed with menus, knobs and buttons, but because it is so radically simple, which makes it flexible.

I've been using Flowlist daily for more than a year now, and it has honestly changed my life. I feel more in control and on the ball with all my various endeavours. I do more in a day and I do more of the important stuff.

At the same time, nothing gets lost: no errand, no urgent task, no small idea. Knowing that nothing gets lost made me calmer and more relaxed, and it also improved my ability to concentrate on the task at hand.

Here are some of my personal workflows:

### 3.1. Top Level Categories

I created these items in my root or "Home" item: Today, Projects, Upcoming, Personal Growth, Business, Relationships and Errands. Those are my top level "Categories".

You could create different ones, and their order can constantly change due to prioritization.

### 3.2. Upcoming

I put appointments, stuff that I want to do soon, that is bound by deadlines or that is just relatively urgent into the top level category "Upcoming". Those can also just be reminders of bigger items or projects in other top level categories.

Of course, I prioritize the upcoming items, so that they are listed in the order I plan to check them off.

### 3.3. Today

Every morning, I plan the day by creating a list in the top level item "Today":

1. Check off, move elsewhere or delete stuff that isn't relevant anymore.
2. Copy my template "Daily Routines" for daily recurring habits to "Today". This includes checklists for morning routine, workout, yoga, shoulder recovery and supplements.
3. Scan upcoming items and other categories. Move or add appropriate items to "Today" list.
4. Prioritize items in "Today" so that they're listed in the order I plan to check them off. This is an opportunity to put important stuff first. I also try to batch process. For example, if several items have to be done in the city, I group them together as a "City" item and prioritize it.
5. The planning takes about 10 minutes. After that, I can just execute and check off today's items top to bottom. At least, I have orientation and perspective throughout the day, which allows me to shift things around if necessary.

### 3.4. Keeping Track

* prioritizing so current task can be quickly accessed via right arrow key alone, prioritizing the important stuff (stephen covey matrix...)
* constantly keeping track: where am i now? current stuff in progress

### 3.5. Thought Process

* live support of thought process... figuring things out... adding subitems as Description
* You also can copy content from any text, PDF or website and paste it as items into Flowlist.

## 4. What Flowlist Will Become

Put on shades, the future is bright. Version 1.0 isn't even the beginning. I have many great things planned for Flowlist.

* A system wide keyboard short cut will allow you to quickly capture thoughts, even while you're using other apps. Neither will you forget anything nor will you be distracted. Whenever you have an idea, you capture it and just move on with whatever you're doing.

* Each item will have a long form description text. This seemingly minor addition will turn Flowlist into a creative writing tool. Organizing thoughts will, at the same time, structure and grow a potential text. You'll be able to export any item as plain text, LaTeX, markdown or HTML, with autogenerated headers, subheaders and so forth.

* Flowlist will have independent filters that let you customize what items you see. There'll be a custom tag hierarchy, colors, a live keyword search, due dates and more task states like "in progress" or "trashed". For example you'll be able to setup a filter that shows all work-related appointments and tasks of today.

* So I have many great things planned, like a shortcut for adding items when using other apps, a synchronized iOS app, as well as independent filters for keywords, tags, colors and due dates.

* Users and Backers of the app can vote on which features I will add next. <INSERT LINK>

## 5. How Anyone Can Try Flowlist

Want to try it yourself? Go to flowlistapp.com and download Flowlist for free from the AppStore.

The free trial version has just 1 limitation: It cannot hold more than 100 items at the same time. Other than that, it has all features, it saves all your items, you can use it forever, and it is totally free, you don't even have to give away your email. Go to flowlistapp.com and start organizing your thoughts and your life today!

I really don't like paid subscriptions. So I'll never require this for Flowlist. You pay once, then you can use the app forever.

Flowlist costs much less than conventional task managers and it always will besause, honestly, the competition's pricing is ridiculous. One reason why they are so expensive is that the concept (domain model) they started with is not as thought trough, elegant and universal as that of Flowlist. So the same amount of invested resources adds much less capabilities to their apps, i.e. their development is more expensive.

Now, as I'll make Flowlist more and more powerful, I'll have to adjust the price a bit. But I also reward your trust: When you have the app, you'll get all new features as free updates. For early birds, Flowlist is a steal.

* Flowlist is now available on the Mac AppStore.
* Use it for free with up to 100 items, ...
* Or, support further development and unlock the full version.
* No subscription required.
* I even offer an introductory price over the whole summer.
* Of course, I'll have to adjust the price when adding features, but I also reward those who get onboard early.
* Once you have the full version, you get all new features as free updates.
* Sounds fair? Go to flowlistapp.com and start organizing your thoughts and your life today!
