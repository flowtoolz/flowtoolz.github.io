## 1. Why I Built Flowlist

Sometimes, I feel overwhelmed by all the stuff I have to do, and even more by all the stuff I'm passionate about. So, most of my life, I've been on a quest to sort myself out, get more shit done and turn more ideas into real things.

The task managers I used to organize my TODOs and **thoughts** played a central role in that quest. And I've used them all, some for a long time: Todoist, Wunderlist, Agenda, Omnifocus, Flow, Anydo, Things, Trello and Apple's Reminders app.

You guessed it - I found all those task managers frustrating. They just felt rigid, cumbersome and distracting. One particular aspect they all share doesn't jive at all with the way I think: They force your notes into fixed categories like *Project*, *Task*, *Subtask* and *Description*.

However reality isn't fragmented by such arbitrary categories, much less can you know the category or abstraction level of a thought the moment it pops into your head. The structure of ideas, tasks or "projects" rather emerges from the process of thinking about- or working on them.

Because they are so rigid, conventional task managers are really bad at capturing thoughts, brainstorming, developing ideas through "live thinking" or iterating over tasks and projects over time.

I need to evolve my captured items to keep them in line with reality. I need a tool that supports an agile (i.e. realistic) way of thinking, working and living. That means, it must allow to freely mould the item hierarchy: Group items together, add sub items "into" an item, move items to a whole different level, and so forth.

So in June 2017, I prototyped a novel kind of task manager and named it **Flowlist**. And I've been happily using it every day since. This year, I decided to turn Flowlist into much more and make it available to you. Now, after 564 Git commits, Flowlist is finally [available on the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/flowlist/id1396163478?ls=1).

## 2. How Flowlist Works

Flowlist is radically simple but subtle and powerful. This 30 second clip shows some work flows in action:

</video>

I wanted Flowlist to enable deep focus and getting into a flow state. This led me to a couple of seemingly radical design choices. Let's look at the 3 most important ones.

### 2.1. A Simple But Universal Data Model

Flowlist does not force your stuff into categories like project, task, subtask or description. Instead, there are just titled items. But those items may contain other items, just like folders on your computer.

So you evolve your own item hierarchy:

* Group items together
* Add subitems into any item
* Move items to a whole different level in the hierarchy, i.e. into any other item including the root or "home" item.

There's no limit to how deeply nested your items can be, and you can edit this hierarchy in every way to keep it true to your life

### 2.2. Total Control Via Few Keys

A core characteristic of Flowlist is that its simplicity allows the user to control it without mouse or trackpad. With just a few intelligently laid out key commands, the user has all the power at his fingertips. And that's only suitable for a productivity app that takes a lot of text input anyway.

This keyboard-centric input has some nice implications:

* It is fast.
* Input is uninterrupted. Your hands never have to leave the keyboard for anything. That also means your attention can stay zoned in on the content on the screen.
* It allows the interface to be super clean, without any distracting clutter.

### 2.3. An Immersive UI: Clean, Focused and Animated

* You chose the scope of your focus by navigating your item hierarchy. No matter on what level you are, there's always an overview to the left and possibly details of a selected item to the right. You always focus and edit the list in the middle.
* There's nothing else that could distract you. The interface is super clean. No buttons, knobs, alerts, popups and such clutter.
* All navigation and editing is animated. So it's easy for the eyes to keep track of where you are and how the items and the overall item structure changes.
* The UI is best used in fullscreen mode. However, Flowlist also provides a "Monotasking" mode in which all other apps, the dock and the menu bar are hidden. Those modes support deep focus.
* All window management can be done via key commands as well, and those commands go both ways: they activate and deactivate the respective mode:
    - Enter/leave fullscreen: ⌘F
    - Monotasking/multitasking: ⌘M
    - Close/show window: ⌘W

## 3. How I Use Flowlist

I use Flowlist to:

1. Capture whatever pops into my head
2. Support my thought process
3. Grow a backlog of ideas
4. Establish valuable habits
5. Manage tasks and projects
6. Keep track of responsibilities
7. Plan my day and my future

Now, Flowlist can do all these things, not because it's packed with menus, knobs and buttons, but because it is so radically simple. It is like lego: The building blocks are primitive, but you can build anything you want. The way people use Flowlist is as individual as the way they use a notebook.

I've been using Flowlist daily for more than a year now, and it has honestly changed my life. I feel more in control and on the ball with all my various endeavours. I do more in a day and I do more of the important stuff.

At the same time, nothing gets lost: no errand, no urgent task, no small idea. Knowing that nothing gets lost made me calmer and more relaxed, and it also improved my ability to concentrate on the task at hand.

Here are five aspects of how I personally use Flowlist:

### 3.1. Top Level Categories

I created these items in my root or "Home" item: Today, Projects, Upcoming, Personal Growth, Business, Relationships and Errands. Those are my top level "Categories".

You could create different ones, and their order can constantly change due to prioritization.

### 3.2. Upcoming

I put appointments, stuff that I want to do soon, that is bound by deadlines or that is just relatively urgent into the top level category "Upcoming". Those can also just be reminders of bigger items or projects in other top level categories.

Of course, I prioritize the upcoming items, so that they are listed in the order I plan to check them off.

### 3.3. Today

Every morning, I plan the day by creating a list in the top level item "Today":

1. Check off, move elsewhere or delete stuff that isn't relevant anymore.
2. Copy my template "Daily Routines" for daily recurring habits to "Today". This includes checklists for morning routine, workout, yoga, shoulder recovery and supplements.
3. Scan upcoming items and other categories. Move or add appropriate items to "Today" list.
4. Prioritize items in "Today" so that they're listed in the order I plan to check them off. This is an opportunity to put important stuff first. I also try to batch process. For example, if several items have to be done in the city, I group them together as a "City" item and prioritize it.
5. Planning my day takes about 10 minutes. After that, I can just execute and check off today's items top to bottom. At least, I have orientation and perspective throughout the day, which allows me to shift things around if necessary.

### 3.4. Prioritization

First of all, visual prioritization helps to ensure that important but non-urgent things don't get pushed aside by unimportant and (seemingly) urgent things. This is essential and goes back to [Stephen Covey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Covey) and [Eisenhower's Decision Matrix](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/eisenhower-decision-matrix/).

Flowlist naturally allows to prioritize on all levels of the hierarchy, i.e. to change the item order in all subitem lists. So, I prioritize top level categories against each other as well as the minutiae involved in small tasks.

To quickly order a list by priority and to distinguish multiple ongoing items from the rest, I also set those items in progress. Setting an item in progress moves it to the top and changes its icon to a play button.

Now on the detailed levels, prioritization is less about importance and more about order of execution, and that helps me immensely at keeping track.

I have quite a few projects or responsibilities that I wanna stay on top of, some as future options, some on hold, some I'm currently dealing with. When I get back to a project or task, I need to know exactly where it stands so I can continue working on it right away. I want to know what I did last, what I'll do next and how it will unfold down the road.

Through hierarchical prioritization, my next action step is well defined at all times and down to whatever level of detail I cared to define it. 

When moving to a detail list that has no selections, Flowlist selects the top-most item. So I just hit the right arrow key repeatedly to dive deeper into my next action step. Right now, the items in this chain read like this:

> Home → Projects → Software → Flowlist → Post release action steps → Basic marketing → Blog post → Formulate 1st draft

I can't think of another task manager that either allows that kind of depth or exhibits that conceptual simplicity, much less both.

### 3.5. Creativity

Maybe where I get the most value out of Flowlist is in how it supports my thought process. I capture what I think, and I think by editing what I captured. As my thoughts, ideas and projects evolve over time, so does their manifestation in Flowlist. A note might grow into a project, a big challenge might dissolve into nothing, two formerly unrelated tasks might merge.

I do that day by day, but also in realtime, moment by moment. Thinking and editing have become one. This was possible because editing in Flowlist is fast and includes the hierarchical relation between items.

Say I just added a subtask to a task in a project. Now I come across a hint on the internet that will help me accomplish the subtask, so I want to add the hint as a description to the subtask. I copy the related text from the web page, switch to Flowlist, navigate **into** my empty subtask and press ⌘V. The lines in the copied text will be inserted as distinct "subitems" into my subtask item.

Like writing in general, Flowlist is a great way for me to sort out, structure and delineate my thoughts, developing them into apps, blog posts, design concepts, strategies and so on. In that sense, Flowlist is already a creative writing tool.

## 4. What Flowlist Will Become

Put on shades, the future is bright. The current version 1.0.7 isn't even the beginning. I have many things planned, ranging from beautification of the UI over little features for more consistency and convenience up to extensions that will vastly expand what one can possibly do with Flowlist.

From now on, I'll let users decide what feature I'm gonna add next. As soon as I've set up the online voting, you'll find the link **here** and at <a href="/flowlist/" target="_blank">flowlistapp.com</a>.

These are just five of the more basic ideas that I think would add great value:

### 1. iOS App for iPhone and iPad

Of course. This is one of the most requested "features". You'll be able to switch devices and use Flowlist on the go, while your data will stay in sync.

### 2. System-Wide Key Command

This will allow you to quickly capture thoughts, even while you're using other apps. Neither will you forget anything nor will you be distracted. Whenever you have an idea, you press a keyboard short cut, type in a note and then move on with whatever you were doing.

### 3. Dark Mode

You'll be able to switch to a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/visual-design/dark-mode/" target="_blank">cool looking dark user interface</a> for increased sleep quality, decreased stress on your eyes, working at night and just feeling like pro. This will also let your content stand out more, be it text, colors or potential item attachements.

MacOS Mojave (10.14) will introduce dark mode as a system-wide feature. Flowlist will not require macOS 10.14 for its dark mode but will play along perfectly with the way dark mode is supposed to integrate with Mojave.

### 4. Creative Writing

Each item will have a long form description text. This seemingly minor addition will really turn Flowlist into a creative writing tool. Organizing thoughts will, at the same time, structure and grow a potential text. You'll be able to print and export any item as plain text, LaTeX, Markdown or HTML, with autogenerated headers, subheaders and so forth.

### 5. Due Dates, Colors, Tags, Keyword Search ...

Flowlist will have independent filters that let you customize what items you see. You'll be able to filter by custom tags, colors, search keywords, due dates (with calender view) and item states (with addional state "trashed"). For example you'll be able to setup a filter that shows all appointments and open tasks of today.

## 5. How Anyone Can Try Flowlist

Flowlist is free to download from the Mac App Store. It is limited to 100 items, not counting groups, which will suffice many users. Other than that, it has all features, saves all items and will never expire.

<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/flowlist/id1396163478?ls=1" target="_blank">

        alt="{{ page.description }}">
</a>

Users who need more items or wanna support the development of Flowlist can upgrade to the full version from inside the app. Once purchased, the full version is valid forever. No subscription required.

Owners of the full version get new features as free updates, even when the price rises. I will **never** release somethin like a "Version 2.0" as a "different" app with an increased price. This is a way to reward users who back this project and get on board early.

There's also a <i>Summer Special</i> going: Until September 20, I offer an introductory price which is 50% off.

However, Flowlist costs much less than conventional task managers anyway and it always will besause, honestly, the competition's pricing is ridiculous. One reason why I think they are so expensive is that the concept (domain model) they started with is not as thought trough, elegant and universal as that of Flowlist. So the same amount of invested resources adds much less capabilities to their apps. That's just one reason their development is more expensive.
