## Backstory

Sometimes, I feel overwhelmed by all the stuff I have to do, and even more by all the stuff I'm passionate about. So, most of my life, I've been on a quest to sort myself out, get more shit done and turn more ideas into real things.

What played a central role in that quest where the task managers I used to organize my TODOs **and thoughts**. I tried them all, some for a long time: Todoist, Wunderlist, Omnifocus, Flow, Anydo, Things, Trello and even Apple's Reminders app.

You guessed it - I found them all frustrating. They just felt rigid, cumbersome and distracting. So I created Flowlist. One particular aspect they share doesn't jive at all with the way I think: They force your notes into fixed categories like *Project*, *Task*, *Subtask* and *Description*.

However reality isn't fragmented by such arbitrary categories, much less can you know the category or abstraction level of a thought the moment it pops into your head. The structure of ideas, tasks or "projects" rather emerges from the process of thinking about- or working on them.

Because they are so rigid, conventional task managers are really bad at capturing thoughts, brainstorming, developing ideas through "live thinking" or iterating over tasks and projects over time.

I need to evolve my captured items to keep them in line with reality. I need a tool that supports an agile (i.e. realistic) way of thinking, working and living. That means, it must allow to freely mould the item hierarchy: Group items together, add sub items "into" an item, move items to a whole different level, and so forth.

So a year ago, I prototyped a novel kind of task manager and named it "Flowlist". And I've been happily using it every day since. This year, I decided to turn Flowlist into much more and make it available to you. More is to come at [flowlistapp.com](http://flowlistapp.com).

## What It Does

I use Flowlist to:

* Quickly capture whatever pops into your head
* Develop notes into ideas
* Manage tasks and projects
* Plan my day and my future

Flowlist helps you to be in a flow state:

* Evolve your own item hierarchy: Group items together, add subitems to any item, move items to a whole different level. Flowlist does not force your items into categories like project, task, subtask or description.
* You chose the scope of your focus by navigating your item hierarchy. No matter on what level you are, there's always an overview to the left and details of a selected item to the right.
* Your hands never have to leave the keyboard for anything. You can do everything via a few intuitive key commands
* The interface is super clean. No buttons, knobs, alerts, popups and such clutter.
* Use Flowlist in fullscreen or in monotasking mode to really focus.

* Now, Flowlist can do all these things, not because it's packed with menus, knobs and buttons, but because it is so radically simple.
    * Write and delete items just like lines in a text
    * prioritize
    * check items off
    * Group them together
    * Add sub items
    * copy, cut and paste
    * or copy text from a website or pdf and paste it as items into Flowlist
    * There's no limit to how deeply nested your items can be, and you can edit this hierarchy in every way to keep it true to your life
* Flowlist helps working in a flow state.
    * Your hands never have to leave the keyboard for anything.
    * and The interface is super clean
    * With the overview to the left and details to the right, you focus on the list in the middle.
    * Change the scope of your focus by going deeper into details or back to a higher level.
    * Work in fullscreen or switch to monotasking mode (animation montage)

I've been using Flowlist daily for a year now, and it has changed my life

## The Future

Put on shades, the future is bright. Version 1.0 isn't even the beginning. I have many great things planned for Flowlist.

* A system wide keyboard short cut will allow you to quickly capture thoughts, even while you're using other apps. Neither will you forget anything nor will you be distracted. Whenever you have an idea, you capture it and just move on with whatever you're doing.

* Each item will have a long form description text. This seemingly minor addition will turn Flowlist into a creative writing tool. Organizing thoughts will, at the same time, structure and grow a potential text. You'll be able to export any item as plain text, LaTeX, markdown or HTML, with autogenerated headers, subheaders and so forth.

* Flowlist will have independent filters that let you customize what items you see. There'll be a custom tag hierarchy, colors, a live keyword search, due dates and more task states like "in progress" or "trashed". For example you'll be able to setup a filter that shows all work-related appointments and tasks of today.

* So I have many great things planned, like a shortcut for adding items when using other apps, a synchronized iOS app, as well as independent filters for keywords, tags, colors and due dates.

* Users and Backers of the app can vote on which features I will add next. <INSERT LINK>

## Trial Version & Pricing

Want to try it yourself? Go to flowlistapp.com and download Flowlist for free from the AppStore.

The free trial version has just 1 limitation: It cannot hold more than 100 items at the same time. Other than that, it has all features, it saves all your items, you can use it forever, and it is totally free, you don't even have to give away your email. Go to flowlistapp.com and start organizing your thoughts and your life today!

I really don't like paid subscriptions. So I'll never require this for Flowlist. You pay once, then you can use the app forever.

Flowlist costs much less than conventional task managers and it always will besause, honestly, the competition's pricing is ridiculous. One reason why they are so expensive is that the concept (domain model) they started with is not as thought trough, elegant and universal as that of Flowlist. So the same amount of invested resources adds much less capabilities to their apps.

Now, as I'll make Flowlist more and more powerful, I'll have to adjust the price a bit. But I also reward your trust: When you have the app, you'll get all new features as free updates. For early birds, Flowlist is a steal.

* Flowlist is now available on the Mac AppStore.
* Use it for free with up to 100 items, ...
* Or, support further development and unlock the full version.
* No subscription required.
* I even offer an introductory price over the whole summer.
* Of course, I'll have to adjust the price when adding features, but I also reward those who get onboard early.
* Once you have the full version, you get all new features as free updates.
* Sounds fair? Go to flowlistapp.com and start organizing your thoughts and your life today!
